
# Python Assignment Project

This repository contains my Python assignment, which was originally developed in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Contents

- **Python Notebook (.ipynb):** The main Jupyter notebook file containing all the code and documentation for the assignment.
- **Assignment PDF:** A PDF export of the Jupyter notebook for easy viewing without running the code.


## Running the Project with Jupyter

To interact with the project and run the Python code, you'll need to have Jupyter installed on your system. Here are the steps to install Jupyter and run the project:

### Install Jupyter

1. **Install Python:** Ensure that Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Jupyter via pip:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

### Run the Jupyter Notebook
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - `cd yourprojectdirectory`
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal or command prompt.
4. **Open the Project Notebook:**
   - In the Jupyter interface that opens in your browser, navigate to the `.ipynb` file and click on it to open.

### Alternative Viewing Options

If you prefer not to install Jupyter or run the project locally, there are three alternative ways to view the assignment:

- **Assignment PDF:** A PDF version of the assignment is available in the repository. This allows you to view the project without running any code.
- **Google Colab:** I've also provided a link to a Google Colab version of the same project. Google Colab allows you to run Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud without any local setup.
- **GitHub**: You can also view the project directly on GitHub.
