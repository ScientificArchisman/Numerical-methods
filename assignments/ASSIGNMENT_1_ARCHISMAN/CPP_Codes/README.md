## Assignment 1
This project has been completed and hosted on Replit, an online IDE that supports interactive coding in various programming languages, including C++.


## Accessing the Project
You can access and interact with the live project through the following link: 

https://replit.com/@ArchismanChakra?path=folder%2Fcpp_codes&tab=repls

This link will take you directly to the Replit IDE where you can view the code, run it, and even make modifications to test different behaviors within the Replit environment.

## Running the Project Locally
To run this project on your local machine, please follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the Project Directory:
`cd yourprojectdirectory`
2. Compile the Code:
Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports the C++14 standard.
Compile the project using the appropriate command for your compiler.
3. Run the Compiled Program:
Execute the compiled program following your system's method for running executables.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues running the project locally, it's possible that the local development environment might differ from Replit's. This can be due to differences in compiler versions, operating systems, or missing dependencies.

## Alternative Access
If the code doesn't work on your machine, or if you prefer not to run it locally, I have also attached a link to my personal Replit repository for this project. Here, you can view the code, interact with it, and see it in action without any local setup:

This Replit repository provides an environment very similar to the one I used during development, ensuring compatibility and ease of use.
