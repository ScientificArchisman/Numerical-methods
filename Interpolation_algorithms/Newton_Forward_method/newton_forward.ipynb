    "Newton Forward Interpolation is a popular method used in numerical analysis to estimate the value of a function at a given point using a set of known data points. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with equally spaced data points. The method is based on Newton's divided difference interpolation formula. Here's a detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Newton Forward Interpolation Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Newton Forward Interpolation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x) = f(x_0) + (s) \\Delta f(x_0) + \\frac{s(s-1)}{2!} \\Delta^2 f(x_0) + \\frac{s(s-1)(s-2)}{3!} \\Delta^3 f(x_0) + \\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "- $P(x)$ is the interpolated value at $x$.\n",
    "- $f(x_0), f(x_1), \\ldots$ are the values of the function at the given points.\n",
    "- $\\Delta$ denotes the forward difference operator.\n",
    "- $s = \\frac{x - x_0}{h}$ is the normalized form of $x$, with $h$ being the step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Difference Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward differences are calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First forward difference: $$\\Delta f(x_i) = f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_i)$$\n",
    "- Second forward difference: $$\\Delta^2 f(x_i) = \\Delta f(x_{i+1}) - \\Delta f(x_i)$$\n",
    "- Similarly, higher-order differences are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Data Points**: Start with a set of data points $(x_0, f(x_0)), (x_1, f(x_1)), \\ldots$.\n",
    "2. **Compute Forward Differences**: Calculate the first, second, and higher-order forward differences as needed.\n",
    "3. **Normalization**: Normalize the value of $x$ for which you want to estimate the value of the function using $s = \\frac{x - x_0}{h}$.\n",
    "4. **Apply Formula**: Use the Newton Forward Interpolation formula to calculate $P(x)$.\n",
    "5. **Result**: The value $P(x)$ is the estimate of the function at the desired point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Store Data Points**: Store the data points in arrays or lists.\n",
    "2. **Calculate Differences**: Compute the forward differences and store them.\n",
    "3. **Interpolation**: Implement the Newton Forward formula in a loop or recursive function.\n",
    "4. **Input and Output**: Take the value of $x$ as input and output the interpolated value $P(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Example (Pseudocode)\n",
    "\n",
    "```pseudocode\n",
    "function newtonForwardInterpolation(x, x_points, f_points, h):\n",
    "    n = length of x_points\n",
    "    s = (x - x_points[0]) / h\n",
    "    result = f_points[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i from 1 to n-1:\n",
    "        term = 1\n",
    "        for j from 0 to i-1:\n",
    "            term = term * (s - j)\n",
    "        term = term * forward_difference(f_points, i) / factorial(i)\n",
    "        result = result + term\n",
    "\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "function forward_difference(f_points, order):\n",
    "    differences = copy f_points\n",
    "    for i from 0 to order-1:\n",
    "        for j from 0 to length of differences - i - 1:\n",
    "            differences[j] = differences[j+1] - differences[j]\n",
    "    return differences[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This pseudocode represents the basic structure of the Newton Forward Interpolation algorithm. In a practical implementation, additional considerations such as error handling and optimization may be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^2)$. This is due to the computation of forward differences and the evaluation of the interpolation formula, each contributing $O(n^2)$ complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of the algorithm is also $O(n^2)$. This complexity is primarily due to the storage of the original data points and the computed forward differences."
