    "### Theory of Simpson's One-Third Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpson's One-Third Rule is a method for numerical integration, specifically for approximating the definite integral of a function. It is derived from the idea of approximating the function to be integrated with a parabola over subintervals of the total interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rule applies to a function $f(x)$ which is assumed to be continuous and well-behaved over the interval $[a, b]$.\n",
    "- The interval $[a, b]$ is divided into an even number $n$ of sub-intervals, each of width $h$. Therefore, $h = \\frac{b - a}{n}$.\n",
    "- This creates $n + 1$ equally spaced points $x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$, where $x_0 = a$ and $x_n = b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approximation Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The integral of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ is approximated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx \\approx \\frac{h}{3} \\left[ f(x_0) + 4 \\sum_{i=1,3,5,\\ldots}^{n-1} f(x_i) + 2 \\sum_{i=2,4,6,\\ldots}^{n-2} f(x_i) + f(x_n) \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the sum \\( \\sum_{i=1,3,5,\\ldots}^{n-1} \\) denotes the sum over all odd indices (excluding the last point), and \\( \\sum_{i=2,4,6,\\ldots}^{n-2} \\) denotes the sum over all even indices (excluding the first and last points).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm and Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: Function $f$, lower limit $a$, upper limit $b$, number of sub-intervals $n$ (must be even).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Step Size**:\n",
    "   - Compute $h = \\frac{b - a}{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialize Variables**:\n",
    "   - Set $\\text{oddSum} = 0$ and $\\text{evenSum} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Sums**:\n",
    "   - For $i = 1$ to $n-1$:\n",
    "     - If $i$ is odd, add $f(a + i \\cdot h)$ to $\\text{oddSum}$.\n",
    "     - If $i$ is even, add $f(a + i \\cdot h)$ to $\\text{evenSum}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculate Final Integral**:\n",
    "   - Compute \\( \\text{integral} = \\frac{h}{3} \\times \\left[ f(a) + 4 \\times \\text{oddSum} + 2 \\times \\text{evenSum} + f(b) \\right] \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Output**: Return \\( \\text{integral} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pseudocode\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simpson's One-Third Rule is more accurate than the Trapezoidal Rule for functions that are well approximated by parabolas over small intervals.\n",
    "- The rule requires that the number of sub-intervals \\( n \\) be even. If \\( n \\) is odd, the rule cannot be directly applied.\n",
    "- The accuracy of the approximation increases with the increase in the number of sub-intervals \\( n \\). However, this also increases computational effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Questions\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Derivation**: Derive Simpson's One-Third Rule starting from the approximation of the integral using a second-degree polynomial (parabola). Show how the coefficients 1, 4, and 2 arise in the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Analysis**: Derive an expression for the error in Simpson's One-Third Rule. Discuss the relation between the error, the fourth derivative of the function $f(x)$, and the interval width $h$. The error term is often given by $$E = -\\frac{h^5}{90}(b-a)f^{(4)}(\\xi)$$ where $\\xi$ is some value in the interval $[a, b]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rule Comparison**: Compare Simpson's One-Third Rule with the Trapezoidal Rule in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. In which scenarios is Simpson's rule more accurate?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rule Extension**: Explain how Simpson's One-Third Rule can be adapted for cases where the number of sub-intervals $n$ is odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Limiting Behavior**: Discuss the limiting behavior of Simpson's One-Third Rule as the number of sub-intervals $n$ approaches infinity. How does this relate to the fundamental theorem of calculus?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Questions\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Application**: Use Simpson's One-Third Rule to estimate the integral of $f(x) = x^3$ from $a = 1$ to $b = 3$ with $n = 4$. Compare your answer with the exact integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Programming Challenge**: Implement Simpson's One-Third Rule in a programming language of your choice. Test it with $f(x) = e^x$ over the interval from 0 to 1 and compare the results with the analytical integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Real-World Data**: Apply Simpson's One-Third Rule to approximate the area under a curve represented by experimental data points. Discuss handling data that isn't evenly spaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparative Analysis**: Estimate the integral of $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ from $0$ to $\\pi$ using Simpson's One-Third Rule. Vary $n$ (e.g., 4, 6, 8) and observe the improvements in approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Challenging Function**: Estimate the integral of a rapidly changing function, such as $f(x) = \\sin(10x)$ from $0$ to $\\pi$, using Simpson's One-Third Rule. Discuss challenges and strategies for selecting an appropriate $n$."
